# About

### Hi there. My name is Hugo and this is my website. Glad to have you with me

If you didn't know how you got here, you shouldn't have trusted that rabbit.
If you do know how you got here, welcome to RabbitHole, me in html.
In here you'll find a little bit of who I am, and of course what I think, this is the Internet after all.

#### Critical Role

![Critical Role](../assets/img/critrole.jpg)

A bunch of nerdy ass voice actors playing dungeons and dragons. What this show did for me I cannot describe, but damn do I love it. If you never watch it, go and take a look. Trust me, you won't be dissapointed.

#### Videogames

> AKA "We all have our vices"

How else do I kill time you say? Playing a plethora of games in my PC so varied I cannot condense them in genres.
A few good ones are: ES5: Skyrim, League of Legends, The Witcher 3, Undertale (OH YES), Dark Souls, etc.

#### Not all fun comes from Games

![Games](../assets/img/prog.png)

If you didn't know already, I love to code. 
Powered by coffee, more coffee and sleep deprivation, I enjoy every line of code that I write. 
Unless it's Java. No one likes Java. No one.

### Me but in words

I like to think that I'm not complicated. Friends say that's far from the truth.
I enjoy the company of those friends, and I get completely enveloped in my work most of the time until I finish it, best if I work with them.
If you ever think you have a cool project that you need help with, I'm probably going to say yes to helping you, 
I'm always looking for new and exciting projects to work on.

#### Dreams - Shooting up high?

I feel like having dreams makes me be asleep, so I prefer to have short/mid term objectives.
I just picture what I need to achieve in 2 weeks, or a month or a year, and plan the next day with that in mind.
A few of those are to finish my Integrated Masters, work in a company that I admire and just enjoy the ride.

#### Work - Thought Fueled Programming
Taking the Software Engineering track never made me look back. Today I like to entertain myself with code snipets and 
try to make my colleagues work easier with //coments. I love Computer Graphics, Distributed Systems and low level Programming.
In my field standards change by the hour, and the feeling of being updated with trends, languages and projects is one that I cherish.
Don't get me wrong, C is love and C++ is life, but Ruby, Python, React and "new" languages like Go and Rust are interesting and worth trying in a project. Or 20.

#### Music - My rythm
There are not two days in a row where I'm listening to the same genre of music, not because I change opinon, but because the music that I hear depends on my day, my activity or even my mood. I tend to cycle through Rock, Grunge, Piano, Classical music, electronic and Chillhop.

#### DnD - My favourite time (and player) killer
Have you ever heard of Dungeons and Dragons? This tabletop game is one of my favourite games, and I love it so much I'll talk to everyone about it. I'm a Dungeon Master, not that good yet, but I'm getting the practice there to make my friends games more enjoyable and of course 
to make the overall experience more amazing that what it is already.
