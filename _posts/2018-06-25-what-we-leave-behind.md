## What we leave behind

I woke up yesterday morning like any other day since I've been in Groningen. 
Woke up normally, got dressed lazily, went downstairs and had breakfast and continued forth with my day.
But I did not go to bed like any other day. As fate, or karma or coincidence or whatever post-modernists call today to the 
unavoidable unknowing reality that is what happens to us, would have it, it decided to after months of consistent 
normality, give me a happy moment. You may say that it is good that it happened. You may say that it is better than nothing.
But why would it happen now, after all this time? 

I met someone. Someone nice. Someone great. That person is just plain awesome. Have you ever wondered why you don't click with 
some people but you click with others? Why there are persons that you just could talk for hours, about anything, and don't know why? 

In case you don't know, I'm leaving on friday. The probabily of me seeing anyone from here again is slim, and that to me is fine.
Or it _was_ fine. I don't know anymore. I don't want to leave this person behind, but what should I do? I have never been as happy and sad since I came here. Was there any need to do so now? Why not earlier, and why at all? 

"Tell me a secret. Something that no one knows about you" - I said. She laughed, maybe because she found what I just said 
ridiculous or maybe because she found it amusing. "I don't have anything in mind" - she replied with a smirk in her face. 
Almost defiantly, like challenging me to see what I'd do. "I'll start then" I said followed by a secret of mine. She could read my face, I didn't even need to speak and she read me like a book. She knew when I was being truthful and when I was full of bullshit, a skill, I must say, not many posess. The night followed by an incredible exchange of secrets. I had only met her for a few hours and we both felt like we've always known each other.

There was a build up for this moment. A reason behind me wanting to exchange a secret. All due to an orange ping 
pong ball. Yes, you've read that correctly, an orange ping pong ball. We invented a simple game, I have the ball in my hand and she takes it, and then I do the same, and we keep going until one of us decides to keep the ball or 
decides that the other person should keep it. It was such a silly game, no meaning behind it, just focusing on the ball 
and whether or not to take it. There is a possibility that in the back of our heads, we may just be passing around something symbolical. Perhaps atention, or a show of kindness, a "how willing are you to let the other person keep it?". There is no winning, no losing, no meaning to it, and however we both kept doing it. I don't remeber connecting that way with anyone. 
We were both attentive on the other person, passing a tiny spheric object around, which has "BEER PONG" engraved in it btw, and however, it meant so much to me. 

So it pains me as I leave. I take every sip of my coffee in expectance of a brilliant idea to get me out of this situation. Is there any need for me to leave? Should I come back? And if I do, should I stay? Sometimes is not the act of leaving that hurts, nor the fact that you don't know what is happening once you leave. Sometimes...sometimes is just about looking behind you and seeing that someone smiling at you, it's about seeing how that smiles slowly disappears while you keep walking forward. And at that moment, you ask yourself: what am I leaving behind?
