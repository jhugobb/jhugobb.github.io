## Greetings and salutations!

My name is Hugo and welcome to my blog/personal website - RabbitHole.

You'll find here information about me here and some posts about what I think and do.

Maybe you'll find some of my friend's thoughts too!

I'll try (and most likely fail) to post weekly about a random topic that I find relevant.

Until then,
