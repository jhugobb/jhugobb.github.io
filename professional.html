		<h2>About me</h2>

				<img src="images/hugobrandao.jpg" alt="" />
			</span>Hi, my name is Hugo Brandão, and currently I'm a student in Software Engineering @ Minho University, Braga, Portugal. At
			20 years of age I have come in contact with a variety of programming languages, being now proficient in C/C++ and Java and
			taking interest in Ruby, as well as some functional programming, learning more every day. I don't have a lot of experience
			in general, but my will to learn is ever present in the work I do, making me always try to explore new projects to further
			expand my knowledge and friendships with my collaborators and mentors. I hope to work in the Game Dev Industry, having an
			interest in Computer Graphics and video games in general. For now, I want to complete my studies as I participate in every
			interesting project possible to be the best developer I can be, always contributing with a new mindset and perspective.</p>

		<h3>My drive</h3>
			<p>
				I thrive with tecnologies that make me learn and adapt, making me think about the best approach to a problem. 
				I have a passion for games (and making them!), 
				thinking about doing my master in Computer Graphics and Parallel Computation.
			</p>
		
		<h3>Interests</h3>
			<p>
				I've always been enloved with game, their logic, physics and graphics, making me pursue a career
				path that gives me the most tools I can possibly have, 
				in order to make me the most informed when it comes to making decisions.
			</p>
			<p>
				When forced outdoors, I like to hang out with my friends playing guitar, 
				playing basketball or volleyball, and going to beach
				in the summer.
