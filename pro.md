Hi, my name is Hugo Brandão, and currently I'm a student in Software Engineering @ Minho University, Braga, Portugal. At
20 years of age I have come in contact with a variety of programming languages, being now proficient in C/C++ and Java and
taking interest in Ruby, as well as some functional programming, learning more every day. I don't have a lot of experience
in general, but my will to learn is ever present in the work I do, making me always try to explore new projects to further
expand my knowledge and friendships with my collaborators and mentors. I hope to work in the Game Dev Industry, having an
interest in Computer Graphics and video games in general. For now, I want to complete my studies as I participate in every
interesting project possible to be the best developer I can be, always contributing with a new mindset and perspective.

I thrive with tecnologies that make me learn and adapt, making me think about the best approach to a problem. 
I have a passion for games (and making them!), 
thinking about doing my master in Computer Graphics and Parallel Computation.

#### Interests

I've always been enloved with game, their logic, physics and graphics, making me pursue a career
path that gives me the most tools I can possibly have, 
in order to make me the most informed when it comes to making decisions.
When forced outdoors, I like to hang out with my friends playing guitar, 
playing basketball or volleyball, and going to beach
in the summer.
