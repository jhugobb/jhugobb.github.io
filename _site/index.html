								<h2>Me but in words</h2>
								<p>I like to think that I'm not complicated. Friends say that's far from the truth.<br />
								I enjoy the company of those friends, and I get completely enveloped <br />
								in my work most of the time until I finish it, best if I work with them.<br />
								If you ever think you have a cool project that you need help with, <br />
								I'm probably going to say yes to helping you, <br />
								I'm always looking for new and exciting projects to work on.</p>

									<h3>Shooting up high?</h3>
									<p>
										I feel like having dreams makes me be asleep, so I prefer to have short/mid term objectives
										<br /> I just picture what I need to achieve in 2 weeks, or a month or a year, and plan the next day with that in mind.
										<br /> A few of those are to finish my Integrated Masters, work in a company that I admire and just enjoy the ride.
									</p>
								<li class="icon fa-laptop">
									<h3>Thought Fueled Programming</h3>
									<p>Taking the Software Engineering track never made me look back. Today I like to entertain myself with code snipets and 
										try to make my colleagues work easier with //coments. I love Computer Graphics, Distributed Systems and low level Programming.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-code">
									<h3>Adapting to today's Tech</h3>
									<p>In my field standards change by the hour, and the feeling of being updated with trends, languages and projects is one that I cherish.<br />
									Don't get me wrong, C is love and C++ is life, but Ruby, Python, React and "new" languages like Go and Rust are interesting and worth trying in a project of 20.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-headphones">
									<h3>My rythm</h3>
									<p>There are not two days in a row where I'm listening to the same genre of music, not because I change opinon, but because the 
										music that I hear depends on my day, my activity or even my mood. I tend to cycle through Rock, Grunge, Piano, Classical music, electronic and Chillhop.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-book">
									<h3>Reading</h3>
									<p>I have the requirement that I only read book in their original language, otherwise I feel like I'll miss the exact feeling the author wanted to transmit.
										I also like to write quite a lot, it stimulates the mind and makes my imagination get a bit of spotlight time as well.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-shield">
									<h3>Crazy DnD Player</h3>
									<p>Have you ever heard of Dungeons and Dragons? This tabletop game is one of my favourite games, and I love it so much I'll talk to everyone 
										about it. I'm a Dungeon Master, not that good yet, but I'm getting the practice there to make my friends games more enjoyable and of course 
										to make the overall experience more amazing that what it is already.
